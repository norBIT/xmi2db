# xmi2db
Convert UML class models from XMI files into a relational database.

XMI files are XML representations of UML models. Sometimes there is a need to have theses UML model elements especially the classes its attributes, the assosiations an generalisations in a database table structure.
xmi2db read an xmi file and write the UML Things into a database structure, which is oriented on the UML Structure. There are tables fore uml_classes, uml_attributes, class_generalizsations, datatypes, stereotypes etc.
In a second step xmi2db produce a relational database schema which have separate tables for each class and attributes in accordance to the type defined in uml. The conversion from UML datatyps into types of the data base can be easy adapted. The definition of tables consider the generalization of UML classes and uses inheritance. Multiplicity are accounted by defining array types of attribute. The assosiations will be realised by autogenerated gml_id attributes of type uuid for each superclass table.
Our xmi2db converter focus on UML models of GML application schemas used eg. for [INSPIRE](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/data-model/approved/r4618-ir/html/) data specifications or German application schemas of the [AAA project](http://www.adv-online.de/AAA-Modell/) or [XPlanung](http://www.iai.fzk.de/www-extern/index.php?id=679). Therefore type UNION will be converted to a geometry type and the PostGIS extension is neccesary in our database model.
We use it especially to create database models derived from the currently frequently changing XPlanung UML model to be able to store and manage XPlanung features in a PostgreSQL database.
